# MedNexus

Enterprise Healthcare AI Platform

---

## Overview

MedNexus is an enterprise healthcare AI platform for medical document intelligence powered by open-source medical AI engines.

The current module is **Medical Document Intelligence – De-identification**, implemented as a purpose-based **Clinical Privacy Policy Engine**, not merely an anonymizer. It uses a hybrid architecture combining:

- AI-based candidate entity detection
- Deterministic identifier detection
- Healthcare-aware role and context validation
- Purpose-based clinical privacy policies
- MedNexus-owned output construction

OpenMed is a candidate detector only. Its detections are treated as suggestions and its `deidentified_text` is non-authoritative. MedNexus owns intelligence decisions, false-positive rejection, purpose-based policy application, and construction of the final de-identified text.

## Current De-identification Architecture

```text
Detection
  → Unified Intelligence
  → Purpose-Based Policy Engine
  → MedNexusOutputBuilder
  → MedNexus-owned output
```

Context-rule, deterministic, and OpenMed candidates converge through one canonicalization, role-resolution, context-validation, and detection-merging path. `PolicyTransformer` and `KeepEntityProtector` remain compatibility components outside the authoritative service path.

The MedNexus Intelligence Core currently includes:

- `MedNexusCandidateEntity`
- `EntityCanonicalizer`
- `OpenMedCandidateAdapter`
- `RoleResolver`
- `ContextValidator`
- `DetectionMerger`
- `MedNexusIntelligenceOrchestrator`
- `MedNexusOutputBuilder`

The MedNexus Deterministic Identifier Detector is integrated into the real de-identification service alongside the OpenMed candidate path. MedNexus merges and evaluates detections before producing the final output.

The purpose-based policy model uses `PolicyRule` and `PolicyDefinition` and currently provides four canonical profiles:

- `MEDNEXUS_CLINICAL`
- `MEDNEXUS_RESEARCH`
- `MEDNEXUS_ANALYTICS_PUBLIC_HEALTH`
- `MEDNEXUS_STRICT_PRIVACY`

Text and file APIs select policies through the same resolver. Implemented transformations are `KEEP`, `REPLACE`, `HASH`, `MASK`, and `REMOVE`. `GENERALIZE`, `SHIFT_DATE`, age/age-band derivation, geographic generalization, pseudonymization/tokenization, Privacy–Utility assessment, Residual Re-identification Risk assessment, and the Custom Policy Builder are planned, not implemented.

Purpose-of-use policies are distinct from regulatory frameworks. The future policy model will distinguish direct identifiers, quasi-identifiers, clinical attributes, and contextual or analytical attributes while continuing to use the same unified pipeline.

## Current Document Ingestion

The implemented document-processing path supports:

- TXT ingestion
- DOCX ingestion
- Text-based PDF ingestion
- A unified `DocumentContent` extraction contract
- Extractor registry and factory architecture
- `FileProcessingService`
- The `/api/v1/document/deidentify/file` upload and de-identification endpoint

Extracted text enters the same MedNexus-owned De-identification Intelligence pipeline used for direct text processing. Scanned or image-based PDF OCR and image extraction are not implemented yet.

## Current Status

**Medical Document Intelligence – De-identification Phase 1**

Completed and integrated:

- MedNexus Intelligence Core
- OpenMed candidate adaptation
- Deterministic identifier detection in the real service
- MedNexus-owned final output construction
- TXT, DOCX, and text-based PDF extraction
- Unified document extraction contract and extractor registry/factory
- File-processing service and upload/de-identification API path

Current confirmed regression baseline:

- **671 passing tests**
- **8 warnings**
- **0 failures**

Phase 1 real-document validation completed successfully across samples from:

- Radiology
- Emergency
- Discharge Summary
- Pathology
- Laboratory
- Referral
- Operative Note
- Notification Form
- Death Certificate
- Admission
- ICU

This validation is Phase 1 evidence for the current implementation. It does not claim that de-identification is complete or production-certified.

The next immediate product milestone is the **MedNexus Frontend Redesign / Policy Experience**. Known technical debt is tracked in `backend/TECH_DEBT.md`.
